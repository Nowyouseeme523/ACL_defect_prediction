This directory contains the results regarding samples of the execution of the experiment.

Regarding Non-VR projects, only the classes of projects that were tested were considered.

Regarding VR projects, in order to obtain a sample similar to the data of the Non-VR projects, the experiment was carried out randomly to extract and evaluate equivalent samples, in terms of number of classes, to Non-VR projects. Thus, the results for each of the random selections and the average of these runs are presented.
